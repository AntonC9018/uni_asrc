# Network Security

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course **Network Security** (ASRC).

Each folder represents/contains a single assignment project/script/report. Assignments are all in *Romanian*.

> The markdown files may use [tex math formulas, which won't show on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog). To see formulas, you will either have to convert markdown to html or pdf, with [`MathJax`](https://www.mathjax.org/) enabled, or find the compiled pdf's [on my google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jbw0sAPwpmb11GqfmB-GvjNduR5957hS).

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!
